Hi, I’m **Abdul** — a cybersecurity professional driven by curiosity, persistence, and a passion for solving complex problems. What started as an interest in how systems break quickly grew into a career focused on **how to secure them**.  

I’m currently working in **cybersecurity consulting**, where I help organizations design secure architectures, detect threats, and respond to incidents. Every day brings a new challenge: whether it’s analyzing logs to uncover hidden patterns, automating security workflows, or aligning defenses with frameworks like **NIST** and **ISO 27001**. That constant evolution is exactly what excites me — in security, standing still isn’t an option.  

This portfolio is more than a résumé; it’s a **living space for ideas and exploration**. Here, you’ll find:  

- **Projects** that showcase the tools and systems I’ve built.  
- **Blog posts** that dive into lessons learned, practical tutorials, and reflections on the future of cybersecurity.  
- **Experiments** where I test concepts at the edge of technology and share both the wins and the missteps.  

My goal is to make this a place where others — whether security professionals, students, or the simply curious — can learn something new, spark a conversation, or even challenge my perspective.  

If you’re curious about how technology can be made safer, or if you just love the thrill of chasing answers to hard problems, you’re in the right place. Let’s explore it together.
